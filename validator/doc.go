// This package provides a simple validation library for Go applications.
// Validator is the main struct that holds the validation errors. It has a Valid method that returns true if there are no errors, and an AddError method to add a new error to the map.
// Besides the Validator struct, the package also provides a few validation functions like NotEmpty, GreaterThenEquals, and LowerThenEquals.
